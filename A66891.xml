            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. With what <hi>Carriage</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments?</hi> To ſet the Ark of the Covenant upon a Cart, and commit it to the blind conduct of a pair of Kine, was ſomewhat tolerable in the Philiſtims, who had no Prieſts that were rightly dedicated to the moſt high God: And they had ſo much reverence to it, as to ſet it upon a Cart that had not been over-worn in the ſervice of the world, in the drudgery of their ſecular imployments; a new Cart will leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane it then the ſhoulders of an old uncircumciſed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine: They had ſo much care and reverence too, as to commit it to the conduct of ſuch Kine, as being ſent from their Calves, would be ſure not to hurry it on too faſt, to run it into the danger of an utter over-throw: It might have fall'n into the hands of ſome men much more raſh, unreaſonable, and head-ſtrong: But yet, that this <hi>new</hi> Cart and <hi>thoſe</hi> Kine ſhould carry it as they did, was not without a miracle, as the Learned think. When the Ark is within the confines of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where there are <hi>Prieſts</hi> anointed and hallowed to attend upon it, to Cart it then, whether out of ſloth, or negligence, out of irreverence or careleſneſs, out of <hi>Faction</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity,</hi> is ſuch an intolerable contempt and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as God will not let go unpuniſhed. <hi>David</hi> doth acknowledge that the <hi>breach</hi> which was made upon them by the death of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> was for this diſorder, (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. for God will have things performed in their due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his ſervice) and that affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Offerer</hi> was to lay his <hi>hand</hi> upon the <hi>head</hi> of the Sacrifice to <hi>this</hi> effect, Levit. 1.4. <hi>He ſhall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and it ſhall be accepted for him, to make atonement for him.</hi> By this <hi>Rite</hi> and Ceremony <hi>(of laying the hand upon the head of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice)</hi> 1. He did transfer all his intereſt in it upon God, and dedicated it intirely to Gods honour.<note place="margin">Manuum impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio ſymbolum oblationis crat, &amp; teſtimonium reatus in hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am tranſlati. <hi>Euſeb. apud La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid. in Lev. 1.4.</hi>
               </note> 2.

            <p>But there is a <hi>Myſtery</hi> beſides in this ſacrifice; it was a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>prefiguration</hi> of the <hi>ſpotleſs Lamb</hi> of God, <hi>who gave himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And a twofold end was aim'd at in that oblation; 1. Gods Honour, 2. Our Atonement; for he did <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106351:20"/>I cannot enter upon my <hi>Application</hi> without a Preface; and what Preface ſo ſuitable as a reflexion upon thoſe ſignal <hi>impreſſes</hi> of Gods favour ſtamp'd upon us imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the late <hi>fatal</hi> revolution; whereby we may take a <hi>proſpect</hi> of our own happineſs, in the <hi>proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and flouriſhing condition of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation:</hi> we were like that <hi>Vine</hi> of Iſrael, which God ſometimes brought out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> we were planted in a Land <hi>flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milk and honey,</hi> and were <hi>twined</hi> about the <hi>walls</hi> of Gods houſe, for our <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>ſhelter.</hi> Thoſe Clouds and Umbrages that did eclipſe and darken the glory of the Goſpel in other parts of the World, were diſpel'd and ſcattered amongſt us. The face of the Sky over our heads was ſerene and calm, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Heaven did ſmile upon us. Our <hi>Candleſtick</hi> was ſcoured bright, and inſtead of naſty ſtinking <hi>ſnuffs,</hi> or filthy <hi>meteors</hi> exhaled from the ſlime of the earth, we had <hi>ſtars</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> magnitude for their <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> ſet upon them, So that this people which had ſate <hi>in darkneſs</hi> ſaw <hi>a great light.</hi> God had not <hi>dealt</hi> ſo with other Nations. Here was a <hi>comely</hi> as well as a convenient <hi>Tabernacle</hi> for the <hi>Ark</hi> of God; and God was worſhipped <hi>in the beauty of holineſs.</hi> And God was not at all behind hand with us in the <hi>reciprocation</hi> of kindneſſes; there was never ſo low an <hi>ebb</hi> in us, by our making out <hi>ſallies</hi> of devotion upon him, but there came as high a <hi>tide</hi> upon us flowing back from him. What we paid the Ark of God in <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>duty,</hi> was infalliby return'd in a <hi>compenſation,</hi> nay with a <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage</hi> of bleſſings. As long as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to pay a <hi>worthy</hi> homage unto heaven, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were not only conſtant to involve and <hi>incircle</hi> us; but they never fail'd to protect and <hi>ſhelter,</hi> to <hi>feed,</hi> and to <hi>cloath</hi> us with ſuitable applications of the moſt enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106351:20"/>influences. Other Nations had <hi>Mines,</hi> which they digged with much pain and peril in the <hi>earth;</hi> but we had <hi>Mines</hi> in <hi>heaven,</hi> treaſures that never fail'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not only our <hi>needs,</hi> but our very <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>curioſity:</hi> It was our felicity that God had made out that <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to us, which he ſpeaks of by the Prophet <hi>Malachi:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 3.10.</note>

            <p>But we perverted Gods gracious diſpenſations, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his bleſſings into <hi>aggravations</hi> of our crimes, and making our felicity ſerve only for a reproach to our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude:</hi> For like <hi>Iſrael</hi> we <hi>waxed fat</hi> and <hi>kicked;</hi> our <hi>Manna,</hi> a ſpiritual food that came down from heaven, prepared for us by the Miniſtry of thoſe Angels that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided</hi> in the Church at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>common,</hi> and our <hi>daily</hi> bread, it became <hi>loathſome</hi> to us: We grew <hi>wanton,</hi> and having taken a <hi>ſurfeit</hi> of the bread of life, we long'd for <hi>quails</hi> to be brought us out of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> Countries: We thought <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Parphar,</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> better then all the waters of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Men grew <hi>preciſe</hi> and ſqueamiſh; they would not <hi>waſh and be clean,</hi> unleſs they might have <hi>Ciſterns</hi> of their own hewing out; nor <hi>drink</hi> of the water of <hi>life,</hi> though it ran never ſo <hi>freely,</hi> unleſs it were conveyed to them in <hi>new Pipes</hi> of their own caſting: Some there were that did ſtrictly hold themſelves to the <hi>Form of godlineſs,</hi> the <hi>Solemn</hi> Worſhip of God eſtabliſhed in the Church, who notwithſtanding in the <hi>looſeneſs</hi> of their lives did ſhamefully deny the <hi>power</hi> thereof: Others there were

Such was the condition of <hi>Iſrael, Hoſea</hi> 4.1, 2, 4. <hi>The Lord hath a Controverſie with the Inhabitants of the Land, becauſe there is no truth nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land. By ſwearing,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106351:21"/>and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and committing Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, they break out, and bloud toucheth bloud. Therefore ſhall the Land mourn: Yet let no man ſtrive nor reprove ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for this people are as they that ſtrive with the Prieſt.</hi> When ſin begins to ſpread amongſt a people, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy does Almighty God uſe to apply to heal and ſtop it? there is the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Judge</hi> to oppoſe it, and the <hi>Reprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>Prieſt</hi> to give a check to it. But when God does <hi>inhibite</hi> theſe his <hi>Officers</hi> from <hi>uſing</hi> their Authority, and <hi>exerciſing</hi> their Jurisdiction, 'tis a ſign that people is grown <hi>obſtinate, ſhameleſs,</hi> and <hi>incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible:</hi> When they grow ſo inſolent as to contradict the <hi>Prieſt</hi> in his <hi>own</hi> office, wherein doubtleſs he is Gods <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> that people is <hi>paſt Grace,</hi> as it runs in the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Channel; and unleſs God uſeth ſome <hi>other</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Diſcipline, there is no hopes of their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So it follows in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Hoſea 4.5.</note>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106351:24"/>and put them to ſo much ſhame and anguiſh that they were glad to ſend it back with <hi>a treſpaſs-offering,</hi> and beg to be, <hi>reconciled</hi> to it; the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> they were inſtructed likewiſe that it was not out of <hi>ill will</hi> to the Ark, nor for <hi>want</hi> of <hi>ſtrength</hi> in God, that the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> prevailed to take it <hi>captive:</hi> but only out of a <hi>juſt indignation,</hi> to <hi>revenge</hi> the <hi>prophanation</hi> of that <hi>ſacred</hi> Inſtrument, which was the <hi>viſible obſignation</hi> of his grace and favour to them.

            <p>And, 2. The <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Apoſtles Argument for

            <p>But for thoſe other <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which were not <hi>typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> but <hi>modes</hi> of <hi>decency,</hi> inſtituted to adorn the <hi>ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Gods publick worſhip, being <hi>eſſential</hi> to the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beauty</hi> of it; theſe are not to be condemned, as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> upon the meer account, that they were a part of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſeeing God requires ſtill to be worſhipped <hi>in the beauty of holineſs;</hi> and will have <hi>all things,</hi> in his Church, performed, <hi>decently</hi> and in <hi>order;</hi> and yet hath not (in the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament) <hi>determin'd</hi> the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> wherein that <hi>Order, Decency</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> ſhall conſiſt; but hath left it to the <hi>Care</hi> &amp; <hi>Prudence</hi> of the <hi>Governours,</hi> (to whom he hath committed the <hi>Keys</hi> of his Kingdom,) how can <hi>they</hi> diſcharge their <hi>duty</hi> better, <hi>in the particular determination hereof,</hi> then by a <hi>compliance</hi> with the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of God, and the <hi>practice</hi> of Chriſt in his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> in holding an <hi>Analogy</hi> with <hi>ſuch</hi> Laws, and Directions, as were <hi>given</hi> (or at leaſt <hi>allowed</hi>) by <hi>God himſelf,</hi> to <hi>his</hi> Church of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, ſo far forth as there is <hi>equity</hi> and a <hi>parity</hi> of Reaſon for it?</p>
            <p>Upon theſe grounds we may ſafely conclude, that the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, wherein the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the holy <hi>Goſpel</hi> are to be preſerved, ought to have her <hi>Solemnities</hi> &amp; decent <hi>trimmings</hi> as well as that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106351:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>pitching. And what ſort of <hi>theſe</hi> Solemnities are moſt ſuitable, we have very fair <hi>inſinuations</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of the New Teſtament; in thoſe frequent <hi>alluſions</hi> to the <hi>ſolemn</hi> ſervice of the <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2, 3. where St. <hi>John</hi>'s viſion of <hi>the new Hieruſalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband,</hi> is expounded, in the next Verſe, by this remarkable acclamation, <hi>Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter therefore it is evident, that it is not an <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> that is, a ſacred <hi>Government</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons,</hi> ſetled in a ſtate of <hi>inequality</hi> and ſubordination; nor an eſtabliſh'd <hi>Liturgy,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>ſet Forms,</hi> for the adminiſtration of the <hi>ſeveral</hi> parts of the holy <hi>Office;</hi> nor a <hi>linen Ephod</hi> or <hi>Surplice;</hi> nor a <hi>Quire</hi> with a pair of <hi>Organs,</hi> nor <hi>reverend geſtures</hi> in our attendance upon it; it is none of theſe that will <hi>overthrow</hi> our preſent Church, or <hi>drive</hi> away the Ordinances of Gods worſhip from us, no more then the like did drive <hi>that</hi> Ark and <hi>Tabernacle</hi> from the people <hi>Iſrael.</hi> If <hi>theſe</hi> be the <hi>gray hairs,</hi> which ſome (that pretend to be more quick-ſighted) diſcern upon the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> (upon the matter) Chriſt himſelf hath <hi>ſtuck</hi> them <hi>there;</hi> and if the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> himſelf be pleaſed to ſee his <hi>Spouſe</hi> wear <hi>theſe</hi> marks of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> it becomes us, who are her <hi>Children,</hi> to <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> ſuch for her <hi>gray hairs,</hi> rather then <hi>reproach</hi> her for them. Certainly (whatever <hi>that</hi> means) this is not a <hi>ſetting up</hi> of Gods <hi>Ark</hi> in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Dagon:</hi> but in that <hi>decent</hi> Tabernacle which <hi>David,</hi> out of a true <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and by the <hi>direction</hi> of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> hath prepared for it.</p>

            <p>But he tells us, he is ſure, that God is <hi>now pouring out his Vials upon Antichriſt, and the Throne of the Beaſt; and although ſome few drops of theſe Vials may fall upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches to chaſtiſe them; yet the Vials are intended for the Whore of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and ſhall at laſt be all poured out upon</hi> Her, <hi>to the ruine of Antichriſt and all his Adherents.</hi>

            <p>Why, truly theſe men are much beholden to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and do make much uſe of his <hi>Throne</hi> to uphold their ſeditious doctrines and practices: For <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is their <hi>ſtalking horſe,</hi> when the preſent <hi>Government</hi> is their <hi>quarry.</hi> For by <hi>Antichrist</hi> they underſtand not onely the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> but the very <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy</hi> of the Church, with the <hi>Solemn Service</hi> of God, which is performed and upheld by it.

            <p>But for this <hi>pretence</hi> of pulling down Antichriſt, it is a <hi>ſaddle</hi> that will fit any <hi>back.</hi> Hath not the <hi>Presbyterian party</hi> been called <hi>Antichriſt?</hi> yes, and that in Print too; and perhaps they had had a <hi>war</hi> made upon them, upon <hi>that</hi> account, had they inſiſted <hi>ſtifly</hi> upon their <hi>pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to <hi>that</hi> Government.</p>

            <p>We muſt frame our lives and actions, not by <hi>dark Propheſies,</hi> but by <hi>clear Precepts:</hi> And we are no where informed <hi>who is Antichriſt;</hi> no where enjoyned <hi>to fight againſt him;</hi> but earneſtly exhorted <hi>To be quiet, and to do our own buſineſs</hi>

            <p>Certainly therefore our wiſeſt courſe is, not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our heads about <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but leave Chriſt himſelf do deal with him, and to betake our ſelves to Prayer and Faſting, with other pious exerciſes, to prepare for the <hi>Advent of Death and Judgment.</hi> This is the fifth <hi>Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,</hi> not to <hi>intrude</hi> or <hi>pry</hi> into the Ark.</p>

For he that is within the Altar, within the communion of the Church, is an intire pure Chriſtian: and for this cauſe obey your Biſhop and the Prieſts.

            <p>But this belongs chiefly to the <hi>Higher Powers;</hi> and yet ſomething you may all do towards it.

            </p>
            <p>In a <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> to that <hi>Pamphlet</hi> the Authour tells us of a <hi>Paper</hi> taken out of Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi>'s pocket, containing his <hi>high way thoughts,</hi> which he committed to paper to communicate to a <hi>Non-Conformiſt.</hi> Having procured a Copy thereof (as he pretends) <hi>with ſome difficulty,</hi> he ſends it to a friend, with his leave, <hi>to make it publick,</hi> and <hi>thereby</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>to capacitate</hi> our Conforming Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy <hi>to reſolve (if they can) one of the</hi> great ſcruples <hi>which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>barreth</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Crofton's Conformity, <hi>and</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration <hi>by a Liturgy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Poſition</hi> he lays down is this, That <hi>[A Miniſter of the Goſpel cannot without ſin receive a Liturgy generally and excluſively impoſed.]</hi>

            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:106351:59"/>
            <p>What I may lawfully be determin'd to by my own <hi>private judgment,</hi> that I may lawfully be determin'd to by the <hi>judgment</hi> of my <hi>Superiours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to <hi>ſtated Forms</hi> for the celebration of Gods ſolemn publick worſhip <hi>compoſed,</hi> and (for the very <hi>words, terms</hi> and <hi>expreſſions</hi>) <hi>digeſted</hi> into method, I may lawfully be determined by my own private judgment: Therefore,</p>
            <p>To <hi>ſtated Forms</hi> for the celebration of Gods ſolemn publick worſhip, <hi>compoſed,</hi> and (for the very <hi>words, terms</hi> and <hi>expreſſions</hi>) <hi>digeſted</hi> into method, I may lawfully be determined, by the judgment of my Superiours.</p>
            <p>In this Argument, the <hi>Minor</hi> or <hi>Aſſumption</hi> cannot be denyed; 'tis that Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> contends for; for I hope he doth not exclude his judgment, when he pleads for the liberty of his own <hi>Invention</hi> to <hi>Compoſe</hi> and <hi>Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> his <hi>Forms</hi> of publick worſhip.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved thus;</p>
            <p>That which I may lawfully be determined to by <hi>a weaker judgment,</hi> to that I may lawfully be determined by a <hi>judgment</hi> that is <hi>ſtronger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to <hi>ſtated Forms, &amp;c.</hi> I may lawfully be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a weaker judgment (<hi>viz.</hi> my own); therefore, to <hi>ſtated Forms, &amp;c.</hi> I may lawfully be determined by a judgment that is <hi>ſtronger, viz.</hi> that of my Superiours.</p>
            <p>To deny the <hi>Major</hi> in this Argument, were to make himſelf ridiculous; and in effect, to affirm, that a man may ſee more <hi>clearly</hi> by a <hi>dim</hi> light then by a <hi>brighter.</hi> And to deny the <hi>Minor</hi> were to arrogate to <hi>himſelf</hi> a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> judgment, then that of his <hi>Superiours;</hi> which cannot be done without intolerable <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>preſumption,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſs order of the Apoſtle, Phil. 2.3. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrif or vain-glory, but in lowlineſs of mind let each eſteem other better then themſelves: That ye</hi> (may) <hi>walk worthy of the vocation, wherewith ye are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

            <p>But I deny <hi>the Modification</hi> of worſhip <hi>by perſonal abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> to be the <hi>Formal act</hi> of the <hi>Miniſterial Office.</hi> The <hi>Formal act</hi> of the <hi>Miniſterial Office</hi> is to Miniſter; the <hi>Modification</hi> as well by <hi>perſonal Abilities,</hi> as by <hi>publick Authority,</hi> is <hi>extrinſecal</hi> and <hi>circumſtantial</hi> to it. To make the <hi>Modification</hi> of the Act to be the <hi>Formal act</hi> it ſelf, is to make the <hi>Apparel</hi> the <hi>Man;</hi> which is very abſur'd, except it be in a man of clouts; and truly Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi>'s Argument is no better.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> But the <hi>Impoſition</hi> and <hi>Preſcription</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> is applicable to <hi>preaching.</hi>

That certainly a <hi>Sermon</hi> is never the worſe for being <hi>well digeſted;</hi> And, 2. if it be <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>allowed</hi> by Authority, I know no harm in it; And, 3. if it were not an endleſs work, this courſe would ſecure the peace and ſolid edification of the Church the better; And, 4. when the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Preach other mens <hi>printed</hi> Sermons, (as ſome of them are frequently obſerved to do) this is ſuppoſed to be no <hi>prejudice</hi> to the intereſt of thoſe ſouls that hear them.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, there is a vaſt difference betwixt <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> for our Saviour hath taught us, that the <hi>firſt</hi> may be regularly and fully compriſed in a <hi>ſhort Office;</hi> whereas the <hi>later</hi> hath as many Fields to <hi>expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> in, as there are ſeveral Texts in the holy Bible; and here lies the moſt proper <hi>Scene,</hi> for the <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Gifts</hi> to perform their publick exerciſe upon.</p>

            <p>But I cannot think (ſaith Mr. <hi>Crofton,</hi>) that any Biſhop or his examinant will judge a School-boy,<note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> twelve yeares old, ſufficiently qualified to execute <hi>the formal act of the Ministerial Office;</hi> and indeed, no more can I.

            </p>
            <p>So that upon the matter Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> is ſtill <hi>condemned of himſelf;</hi> and till ſome better evidence be brought to the contrary, I muſt remain (as formerly) in this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Pulpit Conceptions</hi> are (but) <hi>Popular Deceptions;</hi> And to the Treatiſe that bears that Title I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a fuller proof thereof.</p>
            <p>In the mean while I ſhall offer Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> and his <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> a proof, that they are bound to ſubmit to the uſe of a preſcribed Liturgy, that they may be at peace with their Governours and their own Conſciences, by <hi>keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</hi> with the Church of God.</p>
            <p>To do whatſoever is <hi>morally</hi> poſſible, for <hi>Uniformity</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> ſake, is your duty.</p>
            <p>But to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the uſe of a <hi>preſcribed Liturgy</hi> is <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> poſſible.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to ſubmit to the uſe of a preſcribed Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is your duty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved by <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> injunction; <hi>if it be poſsible</hi> (and) <hi>as much as in you lieth, live peaceably with all men,</hi> Rom. 12.18.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved thus;</p>
            <p>That which is not ſinful, and is within our natural power is morally poſſible. But to ſubmit to a <hi>preſcribed Liturgy</hi> is not ſinful, and is within our natural power;</p>
            <p>Therefore, to ſubmit to a preſcribed Liturgy is <hi>moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> poſſible.</p>

            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> branch <hi>[to ſubmit to a preſcribed Liturgy is not ſinful,]</hi> is proved thus.</p>
            <p>What is forbidden by no Law is not ſinful. But to ſubmit to a preſcribed Liturgy is forbidden by no Law. Therefore, to ſubmit to a preſcribed Liturgy is not ſinful.</p>

            <p>Sir, I pray you take good notice of this, that the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian, and particular members of the Church have no publick judgment of office, concerning the Miniſterial mode of Gods worſhip:</hi> for Sir, it is a notion of much weight and uſe in this Caſe; and it appeareth plainly true, if the modifying of Gods worſhip be, as it cannot be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Moreover, Sir, if the people have a <hi>publick judgment</hi> of the miniſterial mode of Gods worſhip, we are under a neceſſity of having what we ſo much complain againſt, and caſt off, <hi>(viz)</hi> a <hi>fixed Liturgy</hi> for the mode of Prayer, Preaching, Miniſtration of Sacraments: <hi>[which]</hi> muſt then be known to the people, and judged by them free from all defect and diſorder, before the people can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Gods worſhip in that Miniſtration.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed impoſſible, for a ſingle Miniſter conſtantly to communicate to every particular member of his Congregation the <hi>mode</hi> into which he hath (by his perſonal abilities and miniſterial Gifts) caſt the <hi>word Prayer</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſerious, ſober Chriſtian, can think the people to be guilty of thoſe rude <hi>methods,</hi> indigeſted, raw <hi>expreſsions, tautologies, ſoloeciſmes,</hi> and <hi>diſorders,</hi> which a Miniſter may utter in his preaching, and praying; yet this is inevitable if the people have a publick judgment by ſpecial office, of the miniſterial mode of Gods worſhip: It is indeed true, the defective, diſordered mode of worſhip which is <hi>fixed, ſtated,</hi> and ſo from time <hi>(to time) reiterated</hi> is more obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and offenſive, then what is tranſient, and ſo by the judgment of charity more burdenſom to the people, the grief of it being continued and renewed: but it is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of office, armed with power to correct, <hi>(that)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth the guilt of the one, or of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the ſum of what Mr.</hi> Crofton <hi>believes</hi> concerning Church-communion. <hi>And whether the Church of God be not more</hi> ſecure <hi>in her</hi> Freedom <hi>from</hi> corruptions <hi>and</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, <hi>by</hi> fixed, ſtated <hi>Forms, then by ſuch as are</hi> indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, tranſient <hi>and</hi> extemporary, <hi>I appeal to the</hi> Reaſon <hi>and</hi> Common Sence <hi>of all the World.
